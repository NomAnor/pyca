This directory contains the files related to the Python/EPICS project.
This project includes a C library (pyca) to permit Python to be a
native channel access client as well as PyQt library (pycaqt) to
faciliate integration of PyQt and channel access.

A set of EPICS-aware widgets are provided that can be used in
designer.  The goal is to approximate the behavior of EDM.  The layout
and PV associations are made in designer and saved in a .ui file.  The
"screen" (using EDM terminology) can be executed by using 'pyuic -x
<uifile>' with no further intervention.  Additional programming isn't
required.

NOTE: This project is managed using the NPA make system.  Building the
shared objects requires that some environment variables be set.  If
you are building independently (not via the larger build), call
'pyca-make.py' directly.  The general tools build will correctly call
pyca-make.py for you.
