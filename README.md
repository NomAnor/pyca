# pyca

Pyca, which stands for Python Channel Access, is a module that offers lightweight bindings for Python applications to access EPICS PVs. It acts as a channel access client, much like pyepics. The intention of the module is to provide better performance for embedded applications, rather than to provide an interactive interface.
